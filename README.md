# CS-300-H7674-DSA-Analysis-and-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problems that I found solutions to include: 
1. How to set up a coding environment in an IDE and have it remain stable and useable.
2. Work to solve problems in sorting algorithms to better understand the advantages of certain coding techniques. 3. Work to perfect pseudocode and other necessary logic statements in c++.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In regard to the importance of data structures, understanding data structures are essential for efficient and effective programming. The study of data structures helps me to find ways to organize and store data that allow for easy and fast access and retrieval of data. Knowledge of data structures enables me to design algorithms that are optimized for specific tasks and to solve complex problems efficiently. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

By searching for different lessons on YouTube, on coding websites and in the university's library system. A great publication that I found helpful is "The C++ Workshop : Learn to Write Clean, Maintainable Code in C++ and Advance Your Career in Software Engineering"

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Understanding data structures has helped me to develop ideas for more maintainable and scalable coding practices. This assists me in being able to have a vision of an application and to be able to work thru the various steps to bring the program to reality.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

It has made the appreciation of the code and the various steps in producing better programs that include: 1. Modularizing code into smaller functions or modules that improve the maintainability and adaptability of the code. 2. Creating code snippets that are more readable. 3. Actually designing a program that accomplishes something of value.

Overview
In this journal, you will make a submission to your portfolio. Remember that you will submit portfolio artifacts in different courses throughout the Computer Science program. This portfolio is an opportunity for you to catalog your learning and showcase your best work to future employers. You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting will help add context to refresh your memory when you review your portfolio in the future.

Prompt
For this course, you will be submitting one portion of each project into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. From Project One, submit your analysis of the run-time and memory for the data structures. From Project Two, submit the working code that will sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. Together, these documents showcase your work in data structures and algorithms.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It will also help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.
