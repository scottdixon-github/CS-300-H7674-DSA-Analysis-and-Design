Overview
In this journal, you will make a submission to your portfolio. Remember that you will submit portfolio artifacts in different courses throughout the Computer Science program. This portfolio is an opportunity for you to catalog your learning and showcase your best work to future employers. You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting will help add context to refresh your memory when you review your portfolio in the future.

Prompt
For this course, you will be submitting one portion of each project into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. From Project One, submit your analysis of the run-time and memory for the data structures. From Project Two, submit the working code that will sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. Together, these documents showcase your work in data structures and algorithms.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It will also help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.
